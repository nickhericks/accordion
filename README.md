Write README before beginning project.

A README is like the face of your project and it should help you stand out as someone that writes great code.

It is the first thing a person encounters before they even see your code, so make a good impression. Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. Use screenshots to help explain the project.
